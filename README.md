# odin-landing-page

For this project Iâ€™ll be creating an entire landing-page from a design The Odin Project has provided for me. The design comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors. The images can be seen in the ./img directory.

The design will not be made for mobile-devices.
